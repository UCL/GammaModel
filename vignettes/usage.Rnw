\maketitle

This vignette provides a guide to using the R package GammaModel, which was created to perform the analysis in the 2018 Journal of Archaeological Science paper 'Modelling caprine age-at-death profiles using the Gamma distribution' by Adrian Timpson, Rosalind E Gillis, Katie Manning and Mark G Thomas. It assumes the user has some basic familiarity with programming in R.

\section{Installation}
The GammaModel package can be installed directly from GitHub, using the 'devtools' package on the CRAN. Invoke R then install and load devtools by typing:
<<install1, eval=FALSE>>=
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
@
The GammaModel package can then be installed and loaded, and a summary of the available help files and data sets included in the package can be browsed:
<<install2, eval=FALSE>>=
install_github('UCL/GammaModel')
library(GammaModel)
help(GammaModel)
@

\section{Age-at-death data}
Age-at-death data are typically integer counts of teeth that fall into discrete age classes. However, due to varying archaeological preservation the age of some samples are less precise and therefore are assigned to several possible age classes. An age-at-death dataset of 10 European Neolithic sites can be loaded and inspected by typing:
<<data1, eval=TRUE, comment=NA>>=
library(GammaModel)
data(Neolithic)
print(Neolithic)
@
Further information about the dataset can be found by typing:
<<data2, eval=FALSE>>=
help(Neolithic)
@
Notice for example site 'PPI' has two counts in the multi-class BC. Crucially, this is not equivalent to 1 count in B and 1 count in C. Instead, BC=2 is equivalent to (B=1 and C=1) or (B=2 and C=0) or (B=0 and C=2).  Therefore a key component in calculating the probability of the data given any proposed model is to first generate all possible arrangements of the age-at-death counts, using the allArrangements() function. Notice counts in classes E and F are automatically combined into a multi-class EF, since there were no counts in the raw data that were assigned to only E or F. 
<<data3, eval=TRUE, comment=NA>>=
library(GammaModel)
data(Neolithic)
counts <- Neolithic['PPI',]
aa <- allArrangements(counts)
print(aa)
@

The number of combinations can become huge if there are many multi-class assignments, which can generate large memory demands:
<<data4, eval=TRUE, comment=NA>>=
library(GammaModel)
data(Neolithic)
counts <- Neolithic['TRA2',]
x <- allArrangements(counts) 
print(counts)
print(nrow(x))
@

\section{Goodness of Fit (GOF)}
The GammaModel package also provides several age-class models, each of which is described by the probability of death occuring in age classes A to I: 

<<gof1, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, comment=NA>>=
tab <- data.frame(Class=LETTERS[1:9],
	age=c('0 to 2 months',
		'2 to 6 months',
		'6 to 12 months',
		'1 to 2 years',
		'2 to 3 years',
		'3 to 4 years',
		'4 to 6 years',
		'6 to 8 years',
		'8 years or more'))
print(tab, row.names=F)
@

These models can be loaded and viewed as follows:
<<gof2, eval=TRUE, comment=NA>>=
# payne models
data(models.payne)
print(models.payne)

# redding models
data(models.redding)
print(models.redding)
@

Further information about these model probabilities can be found by typing:
<<gof3, eval=FALSE>>=
help(models.payne)
help(models.redding)
@

A Goodness of Fit test (GOF) evaluates how typical some observed data (or more extreme) is under a particular model. This can be achieved using the GOF() function as follows:
<<gof4, eval=FALSE>>=
data(Neolithic)
data(models.payne)
counts <- Neolithic['FON1',] 
model <- models.payne['meat',]
GOF(counts, model)
@

P-values are estimated by sampling 10,000 arrangements of the data, but for improved precision this default N argument value may be increased:
<<gof5, eval=FALSE>>=
GOF(counts, model, N = 1000000)
@

\section{Maximum Likelihood}
Both the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE) and the Maximum Likelihood parameter values can be calculated for either the Gamma model or the age-class model, for some given count data. Both require a search of parameter space, and this is achieved using a Differential Evolution stochastic algorithm for the Gamma model, and a Random Search algorithm for the age-class model.

\subsection{Age-class Maximum Likelihood}
<<acml1, eval=TRUE, comment=NA>>=
data(Neolithic)
counts <- Neolithic['TRA1',]
MLpar <- ageClassMLparameters(counts)
MLE <- ageClassLogMLE(counts)
print(counts) # raw data
print(MLpar) # most likely model parameters (probabilities)
print(MLE) # log maximum likelihood estimate
@
Notice the most likely probability for age-class HI = 0 (to 4 d.p), despite the data having a count in multi-class EFGHI (which could come from HI). This illustrates the interactive influence of data in other age-classes. For example, the large number of counts in classes EF and G (12 and 10 respectively) mean that the single count in EFGHI is far more likely to have come from EF or G than from HI.

\subsection{Gamma Maximum Likelihood}
<<gml1, eval=TRUE, comment=NA>>=
data(Neolithic)
counts <- Neolithic['TRA1',]
MLpar <- gammaMLparameters(counts)
MLE <- gammaLogMLE(counts)
print(MLpar) # most likely model parameters
print(MLE) # log maximum likelihood estimate
@

These model parameters can then be used to plot the full Gamma distribution using the dgamma() function. Notice this function requires 'shape' and 'rate' parameters, where rate = shape/mean.

\begin{figure}
<<gml2,fig.asp=0.6,eval=TRUE>>=
# load data
data(Neolithic) 

# find ML parameters for three datasets
p1 <- gammaMLparameters(Neolithic['TRA1',])
p2 <- gammaMLparameters(Neolithic['TES',])
p3 <- gammaMLparameters(Neolithic['WIK',])

# x-axis to cover 10 years
x <- seq(0,10,length.out=1000)

# full Gamma distributions
y1 <- dgamma(x, p1$shape, p1$shape/p1$mean)
y2 <- dgamma(x, p2$shape, p2$shape/p2$mean)
y3 <- dgamma(x, p3$shape, p3$shape/p3$mean)

# plot
plot(NULL,xlim=c(0,10),ylim=c(0,0.4),xlab='age', ylab='probability density')
lines(x,y1,col=1,lwd=2)
lines(x,y2,col=2,lwd=2)
lines(x,y3,col=3,lwd=2)

# legend
legend(x=8, y=0.3, bty='n', col=1:3, lwd=2, legend= c('TRA','TES','WIK'))
@
\end{figure}

\section{Gamma likelihood distribution}
Whilst the Maximum Likelihood provides the single (most likely) point estimate for the Gamma parameters, these parameter values to not reflect the uncertainty due to both small sample sizes, and multi-class assignments. Instead, we can find the full joint likelihood distribution of the Gamma parameters 'shape' and 'mean' via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), using the function mcmc().
